#kelly-The input data of this script is the lab culture that is *cleaned* from non-cell particles by visual differentiation. 
#This is why it is smaller than the input of the next script. This script contains only the live cells, according to 
# manual cleaning#


### Script 1. Training random forest to predict biovolume based on lab culture measurements
# Code takes as input:
#   1)  SFCM training dataset generated using lab cultures. Lab cultures were measured by 
#       SFCM and also by microscopy (for cell biovolumes). Non-cell particles were removed
#       from the SFCM data (i.e. the data was cleaned) by visually distinguishing cells 
#       from non-cell particles
# See associated manuscript for details
